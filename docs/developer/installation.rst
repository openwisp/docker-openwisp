Development
===========

Workbench setup
---------------

1. Install docker & docker-compose.
2. In the root of the repository, run ``make develop``, when the
   containers are ready, you can test them out by going to the domain name
   of the modules.

**Notes:**

- Default username & password are ``admin``.
- Default domains are: ``dashboard.openwisp.org`` and
  ``api.openwisp.org``.
- To reach the dashboard you may need to add the openwisp domains set in
  your ``.env`` to your ``hosts`` file, example: ``bash -c 'echo
  "127.0.0.1 dashboard.openwisp.org api.openwisp.org" >> /etc/hosts'``
- Now youâ€™ll need to do steps (2) everytime you make a changes and want to
  build the images again.
- If you want to perform actions like cleaning everything produced by
  ``docker-openwisp``, please use the `makefile options
  <#makefile-options>`__.

Runtests
--------

You can run tests either with ``geckodriver`` (firefox) or
``chromedriver`` (chromium). Chromium is preferred as it checks for
console log errors as well.

1. Setup driver for selenium:

   - Setup chromedriver

     1. Install chromium:

     .. code-block:: bash

         # On debian
         sudo apt --yes install chromium
         # On ubuntu
         sudo apt --yes install chromium-browser

     3. Check version: ``chromium --version``
     4. Install Driver for your version:
        https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
     5. Extract chromedriver to one of directories from your ``$PATH``.
        (example: ``/usr/bin/``)

   - Setup geckodriver

     1. Install: ``sudo apt --yes install firefox``
     2. Check version: ``firefox --version``
     3. Install Driver for your version:
        https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
     4. Extract geckodriver to one of directories from your ``$PATH``.
        (example: ``/usr/bin/``)

2. Install selenium: ``python3 -m pip install selenium``
3. (Optional) Configure: open ``tests/config.json`` and configure
   variables as per your requirement, options are:

   .. code-block:: yaml

       driver: Name of driver to use for tests, "chromium" or "firefox"
       logs: print container's logs if an error occurs.
       logs_file: Location of the log file for saving logs generated for tests.
       headless: Run selenium chrome driver in headless mode
       load_init_data: Flag for running tests/data.py, only needs to be done once after database creation
       app_url: URL to reach the admin dashboard
       username: username for logging in admin dashboard
       password: password for logging in admin dashboard
       services_max_retries: Maximum number of retries to check if services are running
       services_delay_retries: Delay time (in seconds) to each retries for checking if services are running

4. Run tests: ``make runtests``

To run a single test use the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 tests/runtests.py <TestSuite>.<TestCase>
    # python3 tests/runtests.py TestServices.test_celery

Run Quality Assurance Checks
----------------------------

We use `shfmt <https://github.com/mvdan/sh#shfmt>`__ to format shell
scripts and `hadolint <https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint#install>`__ to
lint Dockerfile

To format all files, Run:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./qa-format

To run quality assurance checks you can use the ``run-qa-checks`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    # install test requirements first
    pip install requirements-test.txt

    # run QA checks before committing code
    ./run-qa-checks
