Customizing OpenWISP Installation
=================================

The following commands will create the directory structure required for
adding customizations. Execute these commands in the same location as the
``docker-compose.yml`` file.

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir -p customization/configuration/django
    touch customization/configuration/django/__init__.py
    touch customization/configuration/django/custom_django_settings.py
    mkdir -p customization/theme

You can also refer to the `directory structure of Docker OpenWISP
repository
<https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp/tree/master/customization>`__
for an example.

Custom Django Settings
----------------------

The ``customization/configuration/django`` directory created in the above
section is mounted at ``/opt/openwisp/openwisp/configuration`` in the
``dashboard``, ``api``, ``celery``, ``celery_monitoring`` and
``celerybeat`` containers.

You can specify additional Django settings (e.g. SMTP configuration) in
the ``customization/configuration/django/custom_django_settings.py`` file.
Django will use these settings at the project startup.

You can also put additional files in
``customization/configuration/django`` that needs to be mounted at
``/opt/openwisp/openwisp/configuration`` in the containers.

Custom Styles and JavaScript
----------------------------

If you want to use your custom styles, add custom JavaScript you can
follow the following guide.

1. Read about the option ```OPENWISP_ADMIN_THEME_LINKS``
   <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-utils/#openwisp_admin_theme_links>`__.
   Please make `ensure the value you have enter is a valid JSON
   <https://jsonlint.com/>`__ and add the desired JSON in ``.env`` file.
   example:

.. code-block:: python

    OPENWISP_ADMIN_THEME_LINKS = [
        {
            "type": "text/css",
            "href": "/static/custom/css/custom-theme.css",
            "rel": "stylesheet",
            "media": "all",
        },
        {
            "type": "image/x-icon",
            "href": "/static/custom/bootload.png",
            "rel": "icon",
        },
        {
            "type": "image/svg+xml",
            "href": "/static/ui/openwisp/images/openwisp-logo-small.svg",
            "rel": "icons",
        },
    ]

2. Create your custom CSS / Javascript file in ``customization/theme``
   directory created in the above section. E.g.
   ``customization/theme/static/custom/css/custom-theme.css``.
3. Start the nginx containers.

**Notes:**

1. You can edit the styles / JavaScript files now without restarting the
   container, as long as file is in the correct place, it will be picked.
2. You can create a ``maintenance.html`` file inside the ``customize``
   directory to have a custom maintenance page for scheduled downtime.

Customizing uWSGI configuration
-------------------------------

By default, you can only configure :ref:`"processes", "threads" and
"listen" settings of uWSGI using environment variables
<docker_uwsgi_env>`. If you want to configure more uWSGI settings, you can
supply your uWSGI configuration by following these steps:

1. Create the uWSGI configuration file in the
   ``customization/configuration`` directory. For the sake of this
   example, let's assume the filename is ``custom_uwsgi.ini``.
2. In ``dashboard`` and ``api`` services of ``docker-compose.yml``, add
   volumes as following

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      dashboard:
        ... # other configuration
        volumes:
          ... # other volumes
          - ${PWD}/customization/configuration/custom_uwsgi.ini:/opt/openwisp/uwsgi.ini:ro
      api:
        ... # other configuration
        volumes:
          ... # other volumes
          - ${PWD}/customization/configuration/custom_uwsgi.ini:/opt/openwisp/uwsgi.ini:ro

Changing Python Packages
------------------------

You can build with your own python package by creating a file named
``.build.env`` in the root of the repository, then set the variables
inside ``.build.env`` file in ``<variable>=<value>`` format. Multiple
variable should be separated in newline. These are the variables that can
be changed:

- ``OPENWISP_MONITORING_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_FIRMWARE_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_NOTIFICATION_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_TOPOLOGY_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_RADIUS_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_IPAM_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_USERS_SOURCE``
- ``OPENWISP_UTILS_SOURCE``
- ``DJANGO_X509_SOURCE``
- ``DJANGO_SOURCE``

For example, if you want to supply your own django and openwisp-controller
source, your ``.build.env`` should be written like this:

.. code-block:: shell

    DJANGO_SOURCE=django==3.2
    OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_SOURCE=https://github.com/<username>/openwisp-controller/tarball/master

Disabling Services
------------------

.. include:: ../partials/tentative-guide-warning.rst

- ``openwisp-dashboard``: You cannot disable the openwisp-dashboard. It is
  the heart of OpenWISP and performs core functionalities.
- ``openwisp-api``: You cannot disable the openwisp-api. It is required
  for interacting with your devices.
- ``openwisp-websocket``: Removing this container will cause the system to
  not able to update real-time location for mobile devices.

If you want to disable a service, you can simply remove the container for
that service, however, there are additional steps for some images:

- ``openwisp-network-topology``: Set the ``USE_OPENWISP_TOPOLOGY``
  variable to ``False``.
- ``openwisp-firmware-upgrader`` : Set the ``USE_OPENWISP_FIRMWARE``
  variable to ``False``.
- ``openwisp-monitoring`` : Set the ``USE_OPENWISP_MONITORING`` variable
  to ``False``.
- ``openwisp-radius`` : Set the ``USE_OPENWISP_RADIUS`` variable to
  ``False``.
- ``openwisp-postgres``: If you are using a seperate database instance,

  - Ensure your database instance is reachable by the following OpenWISP
    containers: ``openvpn``, ``freeradius``, ``celerybeat``, ``celery``,
    ``celery_monitoring``, ``websocket``, ``api``, ``dashboard``.
  - Ensure your database server supports GeoDjango. (Install PostGIS for
    PostgreSQL)
  - Change the :doc:`database configuration variables <settings>` to point
    to your instances, if you are using SSL, remember to set
    ``DB_SSLMODE``, ``DB_SSLKEY``, ``DB_SSLCERT``, ``DB_SSLROOTCERT``.
  - If you are using SSL, remember to mount volume containing the
    certificates and key in all the containers which contact the database
    server and make sure that the private key permission is ``600`` and
    owned by ``root:root``.
  - In your database, create database with name ``<DB_NAME>``.

- ``openwisp-postfix``:

  - Ensure your SMTP instance reachable by the OpenWISP containers.
  - Change the `email configuration variables <settings>` to point to your
    instances.
