Available Images
----------------

The images are hosted on `Docker Hub
<https://hub.docker.com/u/openwisp>`__ and `GitLab Container Registry
<https://gitlab.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp/container_registry>`__.

Image Tags
~~~~~~~~~~

All images are tagged using the following convention:

====== =========================================================
Tag    Software Version
====== =========================================================
latest This is the most recent official release of OpenWISP.

       On Github, this corresponds to the latest tagged release.
edge   This is the development version of OpenWISP.

       On Github, this corresponds to the current master branch.

Auto Install Script
-------------------

The `auto-install
<https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp/blob/master/deploy/auto-install.sh>`_
script can be used to quickly install an OpenWISP instance on your server.

It will install the required system dependencies and start the docker
containers.

This script prompts the user for basic configuration parameters required
to set up OpenWISP. Below are the prompts and their descriptions:

- **OpenWISP Version:** Version of OpenWISP you want to install. If you
  leave this blank, the latest released version will be installed.
- **.env File Path:** Path to an existing :doc:`".env" file <settings>`
  file if you have one. If you leave this blank, the script will continue
  prompting for additional configuration.
- **Domains:** The fully qualified domain names for the :ref:`Dashboard
  <dashboard_domain>`, :ref:`API <api_domain>`, and :ref:`OpenVPN
  <vpn_domain>` services.
- **Site Manager Email:** Email address of the site manager. This email
  address will serve as the default sender address for all email
  communications from OpenWISP.
- **Let's Encrypt Email:** Email address for Let's Encrypt to use for
  certificate generation. If you leave this blank, a self-signed
  certificate will be generated.

Run the following commands to download the `auto-install
<https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp/blob/master/deploy/auto-install.sh>`_
script and execute it:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp/master/deploy/auto-install.sh -o auto-install.sh
    sudo bash auto-install.sh

The auto-install script maintains a log, which is useful for debugging or
checking the real-time output of the script. You can view the log by
running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    tail -n 50 -f /opt/openwisp/autoinstall.log

The auto-install script can be used to upgrade installations that were
originally deployed using this script. You can upgrade your installation
by using the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo bash auto-install.sh --upgrade

.. note::

    - If you're having any installation issues with the ``latest``
      version, you can try auto-installation with the ``edge`` version,
      which ships the development version of OpenWISP.
    - Still facing errors while installation? Please :doc:`read the FAQ
      <faq>`.

Using Docker Compose
--------------------

This setup is suitable for single-server setup requirements. It is quicker
and requires less prior knowledge about OpenWISP & networking.

1. Install requirements:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo apt -y update
       sudo apt -y install git docker.io make
       # Please ensure docker is installed properly and the following
       # command show system information. In most machines, you'll need to
       # add your user to the `docker` group and re-login to the shell.
       docker info

2. Setup repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/openwisp/docker-openwisp.git
       cd docker-openwisp

3. Configure:

   Please refer to the :doc:`settings` and :doc:`customization` pages to
   configure any aspect of your OpenWISP instance.

   Make sure to change the values for :ref:`essential
   <docker_essential_env>` and :ref:`security <docker_security_env>`
   variables.

4. Deploy:

   Use the ``make start`` command to pull images and start the containers.

   .. note::

       If you want to shutdown services for maintenance or any other
       purposes, please use ``make stop``.

If you are facing errors during the installation process, :doc:`read the
FAQ <faq>` for known issues.
